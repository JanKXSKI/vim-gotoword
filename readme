INTRODUCTION

Navigate Vim with ease!

I personally prefer Vim over Helix, but the 'gw' feature in Helix is just a game-changer. There are splendid navigation plugins for Neovim like `flash.nvim`, `leap.nvim` and so on, but they lack support for Vim, so I created this plugin to hopefully speed up a little bit of you production.

Check out `demo.png` for a quick look of it.

USAGE

1. Install the plugin with your preferred plugin manager. For example with `vim-plug`, add the following to your vimrc:

```
Plug 'cirnovsky/vim-gotoword'
```

2. Bind a shortcut to evoke the :GotoWord command. For example you could add this to your vimrc:

```
nmap gw :GotoWord<CR>
```

Easy to go, isn't it!
